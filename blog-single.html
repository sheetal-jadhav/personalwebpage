                <p class="lead">Two years into the pandemic we can all agree the world has changed. Online conferences, zoom meetings, google classrooms, Netflix watch parties, online shopping are a few hallmarks of the new normal. The world has made a paramount shift from being real (offline) to being online. But the upheaval in silicon valley dictates, tech advances will not stop here. We are moving towards a world not just being heavily dependent on the internet but being IN the internet. This idea which seems science fiction rightly originated in a science fiction book called Snow Crash, however, does not seem fiction anymore. With Facebook renaming itself as Meta, Google and Apple investing more and more in AR/VR technology and Neuralink making grand claims to just think with machines, although it might be hard to imagine, there seems little debate that sooner or later we might transcend into a meta (’beyond’ in greek) universe.pidatat tempor Excepteur cillum cupidatat fugiat nostrud cupidatat dolor sunt sint sit nisi est eu exercitation incididunt adipisicing veniam velit id fugiat enim mollit amet anim veniam dolor dolor irure velit commodo cillum sit nulla ullamco magna amet magna cupidatat qui labore cillum sit in tempor veniam consequat non laborum adipisicing aliqua ea nisi sint ut quis proident ullamco ut dolore culpa occaecat ut laboris in sit minim cupidatat ut dolor voluptate enim veniam consequat occaecat fugiat in adipisicing in amet Ut nulla nisi non ut enim aliqua laborum mollit quis nostrud sed sed.

                <h2>What is METAVERSE ?</h2>

                <p>We already have small bytes of metaverses in the form of games such as Fortnite and Roblox. Google with its Google glass has made substantial progress with its augmented reality tech. But metaverse will be one step ahead of all this. It will not be a virtual space where one can log in and hang out, it will be THE place we all will live in. Instead of going on social media platforms, we will have an avatar that can directly socialize and meet people in real-time through virtual reality. Emails and office meetings will be carried out in the same way. Maybe a bunch of friends can get together and watch a two-dimensional movie in a three-dimensional virtual world. Metaverse is EMBODIED INTERNET. You can imagine metaverse where you can walk into any experience or activity, and potentially address all your needs from a single starting point or world that is also populated with everyone else you know. While VR is all about a world created solely inside computers or online, AR still deals with the real world and has elements of the virtual world built atop it, akin to layers of information. Mixed reality or MR, as the name suggests, mixes both realities in a bid to capture the best of both worlds. MR is what powers the metaverse to a very great extent.

                <h3>Global Advances</h3>

                <p>Metaverse has created a lot of buzz. But there is also a lot of research and engineering behind the making of this technology like any other technology. It also has its fair share of ethical issues, which could be a topic of discussion for some other time.. The hardware would include but not be limited to virtual reality headsets, mobile phones, haptic gloves, industrial cameras, projection and tracking systems, and scanning sensors. There would be provision for persistent, real-time connections, high bandwidth, and decentralized data transmission by providers. Operationalization of immersive, digital, three-dimensional simulations, environments, or worlds. Microsoft has gone all-in on VR headsets (the $3.5K HoloLens 2), virtual workspaces, and digital avatars. This involves updates to its teams and Xbox gaming console services, and the announcement of a new product - "Dynamic 365 Connected Spaces". Microsoft is also introducing 'Mesh', a collaborative platform for virtual experiences, to its Team's platform. Microsoft is also building on its Together Mode, and other features which make work-life more interactive. Roblox the gaming giant is outlined its vision for continuing to grow its 43M strong active user base, from 180 countries. It has been announced that the Roblox community of developers was able to recently meet for the first time during the pandemic in both online and in-person events.. Facebook/Meta has rebranded completely and outlined its vision for the upcoming metaverse. The Facebook parent company already has three 'worlds' - Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and has thoroughly moved into VR hardware with the acquisition of Oculus, and the selling of ~4M Quest 2 headsets in the US.. Apple is reportedly putting a huge amount of time, and money, into a new line of products, focused on the 'new reality. There has been a buzz around the Apple Glass appearing around 2023. The glasses will be wearable technology, equipped with the same tech as current iPhones. According to New York Times the market for metaverse technologies — including games, virtual reality headsets, and other emerging gadgets and online services — topped $49 billion in 2020 and will grow by more than 40 percent each year. A booming technological hub like India would likely play a significant role in the making of the metaverse. Let’s have look at the Indian turf and how various players are shaping up the world beyond


The Indian Metaverse Landscape

Mumbai-based VR startup Tesseract, in which Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio has a majority stake, is also promising a “mixed reality” future with its Jio Glass, Quark camera, Holoboard headset, and Jio Fiber. It is promising applications for both consumers and enterprises.

Plutoverse a virtual avatar technology working on series with a character “Aman” (@DeerDost) with digital touch points via NFTs and digital goods so that a user can be a part of the story rather than just watching it.
NextMeet is an Avatar based “Immersive PC / VR MetaVerse platform” that enables remote working, collaboration, meetings, distance learning & networking for business, education & events. A virtual experience for workers, attendees, students to meet & socialize from across the world. Designed To Remove Isolation From Traditional Remote Work. Better Than Text Chat. Convenient Than Video Calls. Powerful Than Video Conference.
To the Future of the “World Beyond” -
Given the various use case that are been implemented in Metaverse, the fluidity with which it can be experience by the user will really matter the most and as we are moving into a world where we would meet unknow people without really knowing them in person privacy, data security is really big concern. It will be also interesting to see the way it makes its way into the rural parts of India as it won’t be less than a challenge to make people adopt such tech.
In the end change is the only constant and sooner or later people are gonna adapt it. just that who provides the best experience, better distribution and ease of access will surely provide a head start and better market share.
