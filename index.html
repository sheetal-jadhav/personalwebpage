                            Hi there, I am Sheetal Jadhav a neuroscientist in training at the Indian Institute of Science Eduation and Research Pune, India. I work at the ____ lab directed by ______. My research focuses on understanding how natural behaviours are encoded in the brain. I work at the intersection of systems neuroscience and computational neuroscience. I firmly believe that the most exciting scientific feats take place at the boundaries of multiple scientific disciplines. Studying the problems of neuroscience in isolation might not be the best of the ideas for the long arc of scientific history tells us a different story. A fusion that sits on the horizon, between physics, computer science, and biology is likely to get manifested in the backdrop of an interplay between information theory, thermodynamics, and neuroscience. I also believe this development will probably happen during my own lifetime and I do not wish to just witness these scientific turn of events but be a part of it, contribute in my small way, which is why I love my work. Outside of doing research I am an avid reader, I read about philosophy, science and politcs. I also blog my views, ocassionaly (working on being regular :P). I am a self taught photographer and an amatuer Indian classical singer. In a world where time is a social construct I am blissfully at peace sipping my chai while enjoying the sound of rains. Feel free to reach out to me in any way possible, I am always up for a conversation.

                 <div> Our eyes send information about the world around us to a region on the surface of the brain called the visual cortex, which is made up of a series of interconnected areas. The anatomy and activity of these areas has been studied to generate maps that show how these areas are arranged. It has been the holy grail of vision neuroscience to demarcate retinotopic maps understand the processing of visual information. Similar methods are being used to study processing of other sensory information. I worked on finding retinotopic maps from calcium imaging activity of ~20000 neurons, from the mouse visual cortex, where they were shown sparse stimuli. I used linear regression and reduced rank regression to calculate the receptive fields. I sorted out various neural populations according to the receptive fields and mapped them back to their anatomical locations. I also performed PCA to find hidden patterns for both ON-OFF and ON+OFF receptive fields.

                 <div>Information gathered from facial cues plays an important role in guiding our actions and behavior. Face processing is closely connected to many other cognitive systems, such as emotion,  action, and social cognition. This suggests face recognition is guided and informed by many levels of neural processing. However, the wider neural systems contributing to face processing, and their respective cognitive roles, are not fully understood. The goal of the current analysis was to examine which wider brain regions are involved in face processing and understand their contributions. To achieve this, a seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed on neuroimaging data. Functional connectivity examines the correlation of BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent)  signal, between different regions of the brain. Regions are said to be functionally connected if they show a significant increase in BOLD signal activity. Conventional multivariate fMRI techniques focus on the information present in brain activity in localized regions. However, activation may be spread across a wider network of brain regions, which would not be identified by this analysis. Functional connectivity measures help examine the processing at a global level, in regions that are far apart,focusing on network interaction rather than spatial localization.

In the telencephalon, the ChP epithelium (ChPe) arises from the Wnt-expressing cortical hem. Embryonic mouse and human ChPe both express nuclear β-CATENIN, a canonical Wnt signaling pathway effector, indicating that this pathway is active during ChPe development. Worked on studying  the effects of overexpression and knockdown of Wnt  genes during the development of the hem (which is a telencephalic organizer/signaling center), using a mouse brain model. Primarily studied the changes in gene expression using both histological and bioinformatic techniques. Also used histological techniques to experimentaly study gene expression changes.

These digital structures can be combined to obtain accurate, fast and power efficient systems.Since physical signals are analog in nature, data converters are needed to interface with the Digital Signal Processing core. The increasing speed and capability of the digital cores has given rise to the need to improve the speed and accuracy of the converters associated with them. Among various available architectures, Delta-Sigma ADC is suitable for high resolution and low to moderate frequencies of operation.

                 <div> The microscopic study and analysis of blood cells is extremely a difficult and tedious job, but naturally due to minute sizes of the cells, their peculiar morphology, or simply because of the simple fact that they all tend to form blobs, which makes it very difficult to manually perceive them. However, image segmentation has made this study a lot easier. The task of image segmentation is to partition an image into non-overlapping regions based on intensity or textural information of the pixels. This project work presents a better implementation of well-known region- based image segmentation method, the watershed transform. This implementation was intended mainly for segmenting images specifically of red blood cells and get an exact count of them in the end. The count is important because RBCs contain haemoglobin, which carries oxygen to our body’s tissues. The number of RBCs we have can affect how much oxygen our tissues receive.

                 <div> Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create two-dimensional images or three-dimensional reconstructions of objects, such as landscapes.[1] SAR uses the motion of the radar antenna over a target region to provide finer spatial resolution than conventional stationary beam-scanning radars. SAR is typically mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft or spacecraft, and has its origins in an advanced form of side looking airborne radar (SLAR). To create a SAR image, successive pulses of radio waves are transmitted to "illuminate" a target scene, and the echo of each pulse is received and recorded. The pulses are transmitted and the echoes received using a single beam-forming antenna, with wavelengths of a meter down to several millimeters. As the SAR device on board the aircraft or spacecraft moves, the antenna location relative to the target changes with time. Signal processing of the successive recorded radar echoes allows the combining of the recordings from these multiple antenna positions. This process forms the synthetic antenna aperture and allows the creation of higher-resolution images than would otherwise be possible with a given physical antenna. Worked on calibration of polarimetric SAR systems,in order to compare and analyze calibrated SAR data

                 <div> Alzheimer’s disease has been one of the major concerns recently. Alzheimer’s is a degenerative brain disease with an unspecified cause and pathogenesis which primarily affects older people. The main cause of Alzheimer’s disease is Dementia, which progressively damages the brain cells. The main aim of this project was to recognize Dementia among various patients. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset has been used to predict early alzheimer's using various ML alogoritjsm. The dataset is small, but it has some significant values. The dataset has been analyzed and applied in several machine learning models. Support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest have been used for prediction. First, the system has been run without fine-tuning and then with fine-tuning. Comparing the results, it is found that the support vector machine provides the best results among the models. It has the best accuracy in detecting Dementia among numerous patients. The system is simple and can easily help people by detecting Dementia among them.

                 <h2>Brain tumor detection</h2>
                 <h4>Coursework project</h4>
                 <div> The segmentation, detection, and extraction of infected tumor area from magnetic resonance (MR) images are a primary concern but a tedious and time taking task performed by radiologists or clinical experts, and their accuracy depends on their experience only. So, the use of computer aided technology becomes very necessary to overcome these limitations.To detect infected tumor tissues from medical imaging modalities, segmentation is employed. Segmentation is necessary and important step in image analysis; it is a process of separating an image into different regions or blocks sharing common and identical properties, such as color, texture, contrast, brightness, boundaries, and gray level. Brain tumor segmentation involves the process of separating the tumor tissues such as edema and dead cells from normal brain tissues and solid tumors,  with the help of MR images or other imaging modalities. This project proposes two different methodologies to segment a tumor from an MRI image and determine the type of tumor. For this one segmentation and one clustering techniques have been implemented. Each MRI image is passed through an imaging chain where the image is preprocessed to remove noise and is further enhanced to improve the contrast of the image. Worked on two different techniques which were then applied on the image to extract the tumor. These segmentation techniques include SOM Clustering and SVM Classification.

These measurements are read by Raspberry-Pi which uses algorithms to compute the location and position of the device within the room. One such computation could be done using the Kalman Filter. Once the location is computed it is displayed.

                 <h4>Coursework project</h4>
                 <div> Detection of moving targets in strong clutter has been one of the most important tasks of the radar systems throughout the  history. Through the evolution of radar systems a number of techniques and methods are developed in order to increase the target detection capability of the radar systems in strong clutter. One of the basic methods is the usage of Moving Target Indication (MTI) signal processor. As the name implies, it is used to indicate the presenceof moving targets in heavy clutter by discriminating the component of the return echo due to moving targets from stationary backgroundThree widely adopted FIR filter design techniques, the least square, convex and min-max filter design were studied. A number of performance measures were defined and compared between different filters for the various scenarios. Obtained results indicate that it is possible to design non uniform filters according to different cutoff frequencies and clutter attenuation values. One can optimize the filter response by defining the clutter attenuation, cutoff frequency and interested Doppler frequency band and selecting a suitable weight factor.
